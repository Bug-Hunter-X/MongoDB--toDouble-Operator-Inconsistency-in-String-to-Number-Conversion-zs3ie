This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the `$toDouble` operator in MongoDB queries for string to number conversion. The `$toDouble` operator sometimes fails to correctly convert string values to numbers. This inconsistency leads to incorrect results when comparing numeric values in the query. The bug is reproduced using a sample MongoDB collection and a query that uses the `$toDouble` operator.  A solution is provided that uses alternative methods to achieve accurate number conversion and comparison within MongoDB queries.
